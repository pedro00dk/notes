# Data Structures and Algorithms

I did not study algorithms and data structures for a long time.
So I am making this collection for practicing purposes, and for future consultation.

Any file of this project must be run as a module:
```shell
cd <project-root>
$ python -m dsa.<category>.<file> # file without .py

$ python -m dsa.sort.quicksort
$ python -m dsa.tree.avl
```
